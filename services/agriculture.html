      <h1>Revolutionizing Agriculture With Drone Powered Solutions</h1>
      <p>
        Drone technology has left a long-lasting impact on the Agriculture
        industry of India and its efficiency. We present drone-powered solutions
        to farmers to increase productivity in crop monitoring to planting,
        Livestock Management, Pesticide Spraying, Treatment Planning, Plant
        Growth Monitoring, Precision Farming, Scouting and much more.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        We use high-tech Aerial Surveying agriculture drones equipped with
        advanced sensors, such as RGB and Multispectral Sensors , to procure
        precise data. Drones such as DJI Inspire 2 accumulate high-resolution
        crop data to identify any issues with the crops and notify them for
        immediate action before damage occurs. Geo-tagging Aerial Images provide
        valuable information that reduces cost and boosts yield by a significant
        percentage.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Advanced drone technology and Machine Learning for Precision Agriculture
        result in improved crop yields and profitability. Correspondingly, lower
        levels of standard input from the farmers are required to grow crops and
        maintain land, water, fertilizer, herbicides, and insecticides.

      <h1>Our Features</h1>

        <div class="text">
          <h2>CROP HEALTH & STRESS ANALYSIS</h2>
          <p>
            Our top-notch drones furnished with Multispectral camera sensors can
            identify disease and stress in the initial stages, sometimes before
            it is even evident from the ground or with standard color cameras.
            Our drone surveys also provide real-time imagery of the fields for
            precision agriculture. The data obtained is processed and analyzed
            during Irrigation Monitoring, Corp Health Monitoring, and other
            fundamental elements to encourage farmers to focus on treatment
            plans.

          <h2>IRRIGATION MONITORING AND PLANNING</h2>
          <p>
            Our drones equipped with Thermal Cameras and Remote Sensing capabilities can help defeat irrigation issues, or areas receiving little or too much moisture. The topography of fields from RGB Imagery assists farmers to position and segregate the crops to maximize drainage, follow natural land runoff, and to avoid water-logging. With our services, farmers will be able to adapt to different environments comfortably.

          <h2>PESTICIDE SPRAYING</h2>
          <p>
            Chemicals to kill pests and unwanted plants such as weeds and spraying pesticides is crucial for maintaining crop health. Drones fitted with pesticide spraying equipment function more efficiently and for a fraction of the cost compared to manual spraying. Not only are we achieving Precision Agriculture by saving time and labor costs significantly, but we are also protecting farmers from coming into contact with various toxic chemicals.
